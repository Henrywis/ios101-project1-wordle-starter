# Project 1 - *Wordle Pt. 1 Starter*

Submitted by: **Henry Alumona**

**Wordle** is a word puzzle game where players attempt to guess a hidden five-letter word within a limited number of tries, usually six. After each guess, the game provides feedback on the accuracy of the guessed word's letters and positions. Players must strategically deduce the target word by using the feedback and logic to solve the puzzle. It's a fun and challenging game that tests word and deduction skills.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Notes

Navigating functionalities and getting used to Xcode syntax is at this stage still confusing.
I intend to finish the launch page and have the App icon  done and lauched on an actual device instead of a simulator.
